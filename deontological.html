						<h1>Deontological Perspective</h1>
					</div>

					Deontological theory holds that actions are intrinsically right or wrong based on their motivation, and are not dependent on the conditions and the consequences of the actions. In other words, the good will itself transcends the tangible and objective measure of the end in question.  Immanuel Kant describes the fundamental principle of deontology:			
					<br><br>
					<blockquote>
						<p>A good will is good not because of what it performs or effects, not by its aptness for the attainment of some proposed end, but simply by virtue of the volition; that is, it is good in itself...Its usefulness or fruitfulness can neither add nor take away anything from this value.</p>
						<small><em>Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals</em>, Immanuel Kant</small>
					</blockquote> 

					<h3 style="color: #6666ff;">Journalism as an Ethical Duty</h3>
					<p>In a way, journalism in its essence possesses these intrinsic qualities that are "good without qualification."  A journalist sees it as his or her duty to report the news and to keep the citizenry informed.  This is done as a matter of duty, and is done on ethical principle; it is not done merely from inclination, but from duty.  Thus the very idea, the very motivation for writing a news article is motivated by a good will, and its thus ethical from a deontological perspective.</p>

					<h3 style="color: #cc0099;">What Is "Good" Journalism?</h3>
					<p>An absolutist journalist is concerned exclusively with the question of whether or not an event is newsworthy, period.  Other concerns -- such as the social and political implications of revealing the ugly truth, or the monetary benefits of publishing an overly sensational article that will result in the most revenue -- must fall to the wayside.  Hence an ethical journalist is one who never withholds the news, even if it may not be favorable for other people.</p>

					<h3>Digital Journalism Enables Virtues...</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Less institutional control</b> -- Rather than several large and powerful news organizations controlling what gets published, in the digital age anyone can exercise their rights to freedom of speech and personal expression.  In order to get their articles published, they no longer need to get them approved by large bureaucratic institutions and conform to a certain political or social agenda.  In this way, journalists have greater latitude to publish stories that are true without qualifications, even if they are damaging to people in positions of power.  This is very consistent with the general ethical virtues of freedom and integrity as well as the specific journalistic ethics of seeking the absolute truth and acting independently of external pressures.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Reducing barriers to the spread of information</b> -- Keeping people informed is a journalist's obligation; therefore, any measures that facilitate doing so are intrinsically good.  The Internet and digital media make news more accessible and easier to spread.  For instance, consumers no longer need a paid subscription in order to read the news.  Also, journalism is no longer strictly proximity-based; it is now extremely easy to write about and to read about news from across the world, not just events that happen within one's immediate vicinity.  It is also delivered to readers more quickly, and often in a more interactive manner, which makes reading the news more easy and pleasant.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 style="color: #99cc33;">...and Vices</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Motivated by money</b> -- Advertising revenue is a powerful motivator for news organizations, particularly online news organizations, which may fall prey to the temptation to publish primarily those articles which will inspire the most user clicks.  However, the criteria that determine the number of users who will click to read a given article is rarely directly correlated with how "newsworthy" a given article is -- evidenced by the prevalence of celebrity-related articles and sensational or violent pieces.  Might this have a tendency to crowd out the sort of particularly newsworthy articles that journalism is designed to expose -- for instance, government corruption or comparatively mundane issues of mounting civic importance?
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Advancing a personal agenda</b> -- It is now far easier for online "journalists" -- ranging from professionals to entirely non-professional bloggers -- to express whatever viewpoint they wish and have it reach a large audience immediately.  Unfortunately, this technology potentially facilitates abuse.  Journalists no longer need to go through formal training or practice rigorous editing and thorough pre-publication verification.  This makes it easier for people to post inaccurate or shoddily fact-checked pieces out of malice or a quest for personal fame or benefit.  Also, it lets journalists be very biased in the news they convey, which is not necessarily good in a profession which aims for truthful, accurate information.
						</li>
