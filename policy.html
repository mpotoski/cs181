						<h1>Effects of Policy Decisions</h1>
					</div>

					<p>How do various policy decisions impact journalism in the digital age?</p>

					<h3 style="color: #6666ff;">Government Funding</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>The late 1960s mark a high point in the levels of government funding for postage and publication services in the United States. In those years, the government subsidized about 75% of postage and publication operations, including mailing and printing in order to off-set the costs for magazine and newspaper publishing houses. That subsidy in total amounted to today's equivalent of $2 billion dollars. This government support increased the financial viability of America's publishers at that time.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>However, due to the implementation of the Postal Reorganization Act in 1970 where the government subsidy decreased by half its original value, the contribution from the government has declined significantly, leaving publishers and newsrooms to fend for themselves financially. This rapid decline in governmental subsidy, coupled with the decline in revenue from moving from paper to digital journalism, has caused many publications to cut down in size or leave altogether. Although there hasn't been any specific acts or bills that directly impact the amount of subsidies from publishes, the funding problems the government is facing and the changing digital landscape of journalism has greatly impacted the financial viability of the journalism industry.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					</div>

					<h3>SOPA/PIPA</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Although the intention for the SOPA/PIPA act was admirable, since it aimed to lessen online piracy from foreign sites, the ambiguity and far-reaching language present in the legal documents attacked the very essence of the Internet: its openness, innovation, and freedom of speech.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Essentially, any copyright-owning body (such as Hollywood, the government, and TV networks) can accuse any small business or website (such as a local newspaper) of copyright infringement. When that accusation is made, the entire site (not just the part that holds the copyrighted content) is shut down indefinitely. Because a multitude of online sites (especially the ones hosted by news sites such as NYTimes.com) allow users to post comments, the news organization has no control over their posts and whether or not they are copyright-infringed material. Fortunately, these acts have been shut down in the process of approval such that news sites are able to promote free speech and the spread of information.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 style="color: #99cc33;">Data Caps</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Despite the increase in web-streaming capabilities (such as live video feeds, online education platforms), more and more Internet service providers (ISPs) have implemented data caps, or charging more when customers exceed a certain data limit.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Although these service providers (such as Comcast and AT&T) claim that these data caps eliminate traffic congestion and prevent rising costs, other governing bodies such as the New America's Foundation Open Technology Institute who believe that this change in internet service is solely for profit.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Because of these limitations, news sites in addition to other entertainment sites are limited with their digital offerings. Readers of online news sites might possibly not have access to multimedia content such as live news streaming and other multimedia content. </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 style="color: #3399ff;">Possibilities</h3>
					<p>What are some possible ideas for government involvement?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Offer tax breaks for newspaper readers
						</li>
						<li>
							Allow newspaper organizations to become non-profits
						</li>
						<li>
							More federal investment in digital research
						</li>
					</ul>
