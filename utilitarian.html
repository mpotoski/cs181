						<h1>Utilitarian Perspective</h1>
					</div>

					Utilitarianism is an ethical philosophy that essentially aims to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people.  John Stuart Mills describes the fundamental goal of this ethical system:
					<br><br>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals, Utility, or the Greatest Happiness Principle, holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					It is important that journalists consider the potential consequences and ethical implications of their work before acting.  Below, we examine the implications of digital journalism from a utilitarian perspective.

					<h3 style="color: #6666ff;">Inherently Utilitarian? </h3>
					<p>One could argue that the profession of journalism is inherently utilitarian because its primary goal is to perform a civic duty with positive consequences.  Journalism aims to serve the democratic society as a whole and to keep private and government institutions in check by truthfully reporting their actions to the larger populations.  By this measure, journalism which achieves the goal of informing the public, enforcing institutional transparency, and safeguarding civil liberties would be deemed "good" by utilitarian standards.  The question is: in the areas in which digital journalism differs from traditional journalism, how does digital journalism hold up under utilitarian analysis?</p>

					<h3 style="color: #cc0099;">Greater Participation and Openness</h3>
					<p>In the past, mainstream media and professionally trained journalists essentially controlled the news that reached the public.  In the digital age, journalism has truly experienced a flattening of the news hierarchy, in which absolutely anyone can post news.  This opens up the ability to provide news to an unprecedented number of people as well as vast new segments of the population, meaning that from a utilitarian perspective the "good" of expressing news and having one's voice heard is now available to many more people.  Moreover, many news sites are now completely free to read, meaning that reading news and staying informed is now possible for a greater number of people, particularly those with less economic resources.  Journalism is much less exclusive now.</p>

					<h3>Decreasing Quality and Accuracy? </h3>
					<p>In the digital age, now that anyone can contribute news -- and consumers expect their news to be delivered at breakneck speed -- is it really possible to uphold the standards of accuracy and high quality that were characteristic of print publications?  There is definitely an issue of accuracy in that anyone can post news without needed to have it verified first; in fact, people can post entirely spurious and even harmful news and pass it off as true.  Moreover, articles undergo a far less rigorous editing process as they must face rapidly approaching deadlines; this may indeed decrease the overall quality of the news that reaches the public.</p>

					<h3 style="color: #99cc33;">The Issue of Impartiality</h3>
					<p>In today's very opinionated world, when news is often posted on personal blogs and shared on social media networks, it is difficult to enforce standards of impartiality which were a key element of many traditional print publications.  This could lead to biased news, and may make it difficult for readers to ensure that they are receiving impartial and fair coverage of the news.  However, this is likely offset by the fact that different sources can represent different viewpoints, allowing consumers to eventually obtain a well-rounded and balanced view of events.  In the days of traditional print news, many people would receive their news from one source and one source only; these days, people can compare news from a variety of sources to ensure that they are not reading articles with a consistently biased perspective.</p>
