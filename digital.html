						<h1>Digital Journalism</h1>
					</div>

					The digital age has transformed journalism from traditional print media to a variety of new channels, particularly computers and mobile devices.  In fact, the very idea of what news "should" be has dramatically changed.  Consumers now expect their news to be fast, interactive, and most of all, free due to new technology.  What are some of the major changes in the journalism industry since the introduction of new digital media?

					<h3>Major Themes</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h5>Speed</h5> 
							Perhaps the largest change experienced by journalism in the digital age is the speed at which stories are published.  Rather than releasing all news from within a certain period at a preset time (with major stories often being published hours after they actually happen), news breaks immediately online.  This may provide less time for editing and comprehensive fact-checking, but is a feature of journalism that is now seen as indispensable by consumers.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>Interactivity</h5> 
							Rather than simply containing large blocks of plain text, journalism has evolved into a mixed-media style of presentation, with pictures, video, and interactive links mixed in.  This has become especially prevalent with the rise of smartphone and tablet apps, where consumers expect a high level of interactivity in the content, i.e. swiping to get to the next article, commenting when they find something that interests them, and clicking links to see related article.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>Flattening of the news hierarchy</h5> 
							Now anyone, no matter who or where they are, and whether or not they have any professional training in the field of journalism, can write and post news articles.  This changes not only the type of news that is posted, but also raises questions about its quality, accuracy, and impartiality.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>Universality</h5> 
							News is no longer proximity-based; news that happens anywhere is now instantaneously available around the world.  This is valuable for readers as it provides a greater wealth and diversity of information.  It is also easier for journalists to contact sources, communicate with others in the profession, and place events in a world context.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Evolving Technology</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h5>Social Media</h5> 
							Social networks like Facebook and Twitter are very useful media for connecting with people and sharing news.  For example, many news organizations have Facebook accounts and applications that provide feeds of news stories for online subscribers.  This allows for immediate news updates and news that is specifically tailored to peopleâ€™s interests.  Users can also "share" content that they find particularly interesting.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>Comments and online forums</h5> 
							Newspapers have long allowed comments in the form of letters to the editor, but online comments provide a completely new way for people to engage with the news they read.  In fact, online comments are as much about people interacting and communicating with each other than they are about reacting to the story itself.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>Blogs</h5> 
							The rise of blogs in the early 2000s dramatically changed the way people -- professional journalists and news organizations as well normal Internet users -- can broadcast the news.  They provide a free way to rapidly communicate information.  Blog postings are usually not polished products, so they may not be heavily fact-checked or edited.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>RSS (Really Simple Syndication)</h5> 
							RSS software is an easy way to distribute news to people without requiring them to visit a website.  Also, rather than having a small group of professional journalists and editors decide what news is the most "important," news aggregators let users select and share the content that specifically interests them.
						</li>
					</ul>
