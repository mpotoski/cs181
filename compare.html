						<h1>Comparison</h1>
					</div>

					Commercialization of the industry as well as globalization has caused the European model of journalism practices to shift in their attempts to emulate the American model of journalism. The influences of American journalism have pushed strong and assertive values and practices on the European model for years. Both the American and British journalism industries, however, are affected by the changing technological environment. 

					<h3 style="color: #6666ff;">Objectivity</h3>
					The technological changes that are happening within the world of journalism emphasize the importance of subjectivity and partisanship and not objectivity. This can perhaps explain why digital media and online journalism has proven to be a more seamless transition for the European industries. As the American journalism industry struggles to hold on to their virtue of objectivity and professionalism, digital media and online journalism assert pressure. Fact centered reporting is becoming increasingly more difficult as it is clouded by the constant stream of tweets and posts of online media, as well as the speed of online information gathering. Because of this, the approach of fact based reporting is slowly losing its grasp on the community. It lacks the vision of social reality that online journalism and social medias seem to capture. 

					<h3 style="color: #cc0099;">European Advantage</h3>
					<p>The European model of journalism today is more successful than that of the American model. This can be attributed to various reasons. First, the European model of journalism is seen today as having more relevance because of its ability to capture and expose world issues. In a time where gatekeeping now lies in the hands of civilians and individuals, objectivity has become obsolete and exposed. This exposition of American objectivity calls into question the importance of opinion and personal commentary. The American journalism industry has held its ground on objectivity and fact based reporting for so long, that it is highly resistant to change. As the Internet facilitates the ease of personal opinion and expression, people are no longer interested in hearing one sided facts.</p>
					
					<p>This explains the pessimism expressed by traditional journalists who are finding it harder and harder to fit themselves into the digital landscape. Traditional American journalists face layoffs and many major news companies have made significant cutbacks to their personnel. Because of the fast evolution of digital technologies, companies are finding it easier to hire new, tech savvy journalists, who have the ability to publish across multiple platforms. This phenomenon is very common in the United States and is necessitated by our highly competitive capitalist structure. </p>

					<h3>Ownership Structure</h3>
					<p>In the United States, media companies reside within a conglomerate. Conglomerate ownership is highly successful in the vertical and horizontal integration of internal companies. By integrating their companies and industries across platforms, conglomerates maximize profit output. Although this is a highly effective and largely profitable structure, this system is what causes extraordinarily fierce competition.  If there is an internal company that is not creating profit, it affects the profits of the companies with which it is integrated. Because of the traditional media industry's struggle to merge traditional and nontraditional practices, conglomerates in the United States quickly make cuts. This is not as prevalent in European nations because traditionally, their companies are privately owned. When companies are privately owned, the pressure to produce high profits diminishes. Private companies can take the time to retrain their journalists, and because of this the fear of layoffs is not as prominent in European newsrooms. </p>

					<h3 style="color: #99cc33;">Need for Integration</h3>
					<p>Overall, the European and American models of journalism are both facing a challenge.  The speed of information technology development and the new forms of information dissemination are a threat to their professions. Although this does not force the journalism profession to become completely obsolete, it is forcing them to come up with new ways to integrate into a landscape that they are not familiar with. Because of the Europeans' lax newsroom structure, their transition from traditional journalism to digital journalism has facilitated a gradual, more acceptable change. Unfortunately for the United States, our long-standing professionally recognized journalism industry is taking a hard hit. The ownership structure in the United States does not place the investment in the people, but rather in the profits. Because of this the friction between traditional journalists and digital journalism will persist. </p>
