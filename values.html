						<h1>Clash of Values</h1>
					</div>

					The following table indicates that the values of traditional vs. digital journalism
					fundamentally conflict with one another.  Thus, is it even possible for journalists to 
					develop a cohesive ethical framework by which to operate?
					<br><br>

					<table width="80%">
						<tr>
							<td><h3>Traditional</h3></td>
							<td><h3 style="color: #99cc33;">Digital</h3></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Accuracy</td>
							<td>Immediacy</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Balance</td>
							<td>Transparency</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Impartiality</td>
							<td>Partiality</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Gatekeeping</td>
							<td>Non-professionalism</td>
						</tr>	
						<tr>
							<td>Pre-publication verification</td>
							<td>Post-publication correction</td>
						</tr>

					Moreover, the rise of digital journalism poses some deep questions which challenge
					the very integrity of the profession.
					<br><br>
					<span class="question">Who is a journalist?</span><br>
						The "democratization" of media has blurred the identity of journalists.  Previously, journalists were a clearly defined group of professionals who wrote for major news outlets.  Today, anyone can call themselves a journalist, whether or not they have journalistic training or work for mainstream media.  For instance, is someone a journalist just because they express their opinions on Facebook?
					<br><br>
					<span class="question">What is journalism?</span><br>
						Perhaps one can define "journalism" empirically, by looking at past examples of journalism throughout history and noting the types of activities in which journalists engaged.  These include gathering information, editing stories, and publishing news and opinions.  By this practical approach, anyone who engages in these activites could be practicing journalism.
						One could also take a normative approach, by defining an idealized notion of what "journalism" should be.  This is based on a view of journalism as responsibly and accurately informing the public.  By this approach, writers should not be considered journalists unless they have highly developed skills, usually through formal training and education, and honor certain ethical norms.
					<br><br>
					<span class="question">When is anonymity acceptable?</span><br>
						Anonymity is much easier to maintain online than in tangible mainstream media sources.  Many say that anonymity permits increased freedom of speech and uncovering wrongdoing, but others say that it encourages irresponsible and harmful content and comments.  When is anonymity ethically permissible, and are these guidelines different offline and online?
					<br><br>
					<span class="question">By what metric should news organizations make publishing decisions?</span><br>
						Online advertising revenue is dependent on how many users click on a certain link and see the ad, which provides a temptation for news organizations to make publishing decisions based on what will bring the most online traffic.  However, this can easily lead to irresponsible decisions.  News organizations will tend to choose sensational pieces that will grab the popular interest, regardless of whether or not this is important and informative news.  Moreover, news organizations might shy away from expressing unpopular or minority viewpoints, if they are constrained by the feeling that they ought to cater to the interests of the majority.
